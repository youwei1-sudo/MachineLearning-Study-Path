# Machine-learning Engineer Growing path

ML learning path
--
By diffculties in general :

Intro: 
  1. Regression(Linear, logestic)
  2.  KNN, K-means, desecion tree 
  3.  artifical neuron network(MLP/CNN/LSTM), Backpropagation
  4.  RL: bandit/MDP/DP/TD learning/MC

Biginner:

  1. bayes optimization,  Bayesian Linear Regression/Logestic Regression
  2. FFT
  3. NLP transformer/BERT/GPT
  4. GMM/HMM
  5. EM/Baum-Welch/Viterbi/Kalman filter(UKF)
  6. Graphical model/Belief propagation
  7. Junction tree
  8. SVM/Kernel Method/RKHS
  9. model based RL/Policy gradient/actor-critic


Medium:

Hard:
  
Math you need:
--
  Intro: caculus, Linear Algebra, probabilty theory
  
  Binginner: Convex optimization(Ex. Constrained opt/kkt condition）, Graph theory, High-dim probabilty theory(Ex. Normal distribution and its linear transform, conditional probablity), Bayesian inference， Stochastic process
