ML learning path
--
By difficulties in general :

Intro: 
  1. Regression(Linear, logistic)
  2. KNN, K-means, desecion tree 
  3. Artifical neuron network(MLP/CNN/LSTM)
      1. Backpropagation, Forward Propergation
      2. Max pooling, Activation Functions
  4.  RL: bandit/MDP/DP/TD learning/MC
  5. Coding:
      1. Python (Numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, open-cv , pytorch, Tensorflow etc) 
      2. Good to have: GPU programming (CUDA C++ etc)
      3. Good to have: Parallel Computing 
      4. Good to have: Matlab, R, Julia
      5. Gits, Unix enviorment

Beginner:

  1. Bayes optimization,  Bayesian Linear Regression/logistic Regression
  2. FFT
  3. NLP Transformer/BERT/GPT
  4. GMM/HMM
  5. EM/Baum-Welch/Viterbi/KalmanFilter(UKF)
  6. Graphical model/Belief propagation
  7. Junction tree
  8. SVM/Kernel Method/RKHS
  9. model based RL/Policy gradient/actor-critic


Medium: 
  Missing Cuz i am still learning

Hard:
  Missing Cuz i am far away , hhh
  
Math you need:
--
  Intro: Calculus, Linear Algebra, probability theory
  
  Beginner: Convex optimization(Ex. Constrained opt/kkt condition）, Graph theory, High-dim probabilty theory(Ex. Normal distribution and its linear transform, conditional probablity), Bayesian inference， Stochastic process
